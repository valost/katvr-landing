[DEMO LINK](https://valost.github.io/katvr-landing/)

# Description
The landing page is designed to be fully responsive across mobile (>320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px and 1920px) screen sizes. It is divided into the following sections:

'About': Introduces the product to viewers.
'Tech': Highlights the product's key technical features.
'Benefits': Outlines the product's advantages.

Additionally, the 'Buy now' button redirects users to a 'Cart' page, where they can fill out a form to purchase the product. The 'Place order' step requires users to fill in all the necessary information to proceed to the next step.

Note: The 'Country' and 'City' dropdowns are not mandatory and are included for demonstration purposes. The 'City' dropdown displays selected cities from the U.S. only.

The 'Pay' step requires valid credit card information. You can use the following test card numbers, which pass the Luhn algorithm for checking credit card validity:

Visa: 4111 1111 1111 1111

MasterCard: 5555 5555 5555 4444
